**Next Steps**

The nest version of the game will be updated with the following:

* images in place of numbers(ie. fruit images)
* a reel that rotates and stops at different timed intervals
* sound 
* flashing images at win including text display _Let's Play!_, _You Win!_, _You lose!_
* features such as add credit, credit amount per number of plays that would keep track of the credit and diplay it at each play giving more opportunities to win which would also reset the game
